      <strong>It works!</strong>
      <p>
        You are currently using theme-starter.css, a base template designed to
        show the available pieces with minimal styling. It includes album art,
        the song and artist, as well as other elements that may be useful in the
        context of streaming. To use a different theme, edit line 12 in
        public/index.html.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you have knowledge of CSS, I highly encourage customizing this app to
        suit your needs.
